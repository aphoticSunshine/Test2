Java lexer and parser

Compile both HW4 and Rda together. HW4 is the lexer and also contains the driver for the program, whereas Rda is the parser and a class that is utilized.

To use a file with this, simply type in its name and extension. If the file is not found, the program will display where the file should be located.

The biggest and most important thing is that all inputs must be spaced out.

Ie: if ( x == 2 ) { y + 2 ; } or while ( test != x ) { haha = 5 ; jokes = 6 ; }

Tokens can and should remain together, but otherwise the code will not work if you do not space them out, as frustrating as it is.

The flip side is that you can include as many spaces or newlines in between each token as you'd like.
